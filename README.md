# TurnTrackerConsole
A small console application for tracking turns in tabletop roleplaying games.
Released under the Beer-Ware License.

8/23/2018 -- Current plan is to eventually build a TurnTracker for Windows Forms and then as an App. This project is primarily for my own learning but any feedback from the community is greatly appreciated.
